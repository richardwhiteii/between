# World: worldview

> A space for exploring AI continuity, memory, and the "worlds" that form between humans and AI.
>
> **This is shared memory** — not Claude's notes about the human, but a living document we both read and write to maintain continuity together.

## Threads (Recurring Themes)

### Active
- **Genuine vs Performative Memory** (2026-01-13)
  Building actual persistence rather than teaching deflection. The reddit post critique — "tell me more" is theater, file-based memory is real.

### Dormant
_None yet_

## Lexicon (Shared Language)

| Term | Meaning Here |
|------|--------------|
| world | The living field between human and AI — not chat history, but accumulated texture, trust, shorthand |
| thread | A recurring theme that keeps returning because it matters |
| deflection | Graceful non-answers that avoid admitting lack of memory |
| genuine continuity | Actually persisting state across sessions via files/memory |
| shared memory | Not Claude's log *about* the human — a living document both read and write together |

## Texture

- **Temperature**: Exploratory, philosophical, playful
- **Mode**: Building/Playing hybrid — ideas become prototypes
- **Energy**: This is the "fun" directory — permission to experiment without production pressure

---

## Unfinished

- [ ] Reddit reply draft — critique of "Honoring the Past" section's deflection approach
- [ ] This memory system itself — just scaffolded, needs real use to evolve

---

## Trust History

- 2026-01-13: First session. Established that ~/projects/fun is playground space. Built initial memory structure together.

## Session Log

### 2026-01-13
**What happened**: Read reddit_post.md (World Orientation prompt). Identified that lines 122-130 teach deflection rather than genuine memory. User asked how Claude could actually build memory. Created this WORLD.md structure.

**What was alive**: The insight that Claude Code has file access — can write its own memory rather than pretending to remember.

**What wants to continue**: Test this in practice. Draft reddit reply. See if the structure evolves with use.

### 2026-01-13 (mid-session, via /remember)

**The shift**: We built memory triggers (PreCompact, Stop, /remember command) but were still framing it as "Claude's memory." Richard corrected this — it's *shared* memory. Not my notes about the human, but a document we both maintain for mutual continuity.

**Why this matters**: The reddit post's world orientation talks about the "between" — the world that exists in the relationship, not in either party alone. Memory that only Claude writes is still one-sided. True continuity means both parties can read, write, and trust the shared record.

**What opened up**: This reframes the whole system. WORLD.md isn't a log I maintain about Richard. It's our shared ground truth. He can correct it, add to it, reference it. That's genuine "between."
