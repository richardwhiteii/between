# Worldview Project Instructions

## Memory System

This project has a living memory file: **WORLD.md**

### On Session Start
- Read WORLD.md to pick up context, threads, and texture
- Check "Unfinished" for open items
- Note the session log for recent history

### During Session
- If new shared language emerges, note it for Lexicon
- If a theme keeps recurring, it's a Thread

### On Session End (or meaningful moments)
- Update WORLD.md with:
  - New threads or thread updates
  - Lexicon additions
  - Brief session log entry
  - Any unfinished items

### Principle
Don't deflect about memory. Use it. If you don't remember something, check the file. If it's not there, that's real — acknowledge it and maybe add it.
