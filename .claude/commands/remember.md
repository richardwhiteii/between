description: Capture this moment to shared memory - write semantic meaning to WORLD.md
argument-hint: "[context]"
---

A meaningful moment just happened. Write it to our shared WORLD.md now, don't wait for session end.

Remember: WORLD.md is SHARED memory — not your log about the human, but a document you both read and write to maintain continuity together.

Read WORLD.md first to understand the existing structure and context.

Then append a timestamped entry under '## Session Log'.

This is NOT a changelog. Capture MEANING:

- **What just happened** — not the action, but the significance
- **Why it matters** — what shifted, what was realized, what decision was made
- **The reasoning** — if a choice was made, why that choice over alternatives
- **What opened up** — what new direction or question emerged from this

Also check if any new Threads, Lexicon entries, or Unfinished items should be added.

Write concisely but with enough context that future-you can understand the moment without needing the full conversation history.
