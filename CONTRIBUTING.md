# Contributing to between

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project explores genuine AI-human memory and continuity, and we welcome contributions that further that goal.

## Ways to Contribute

### Share Your Experience
- Open an issue describing how you've used or adapted the memory system
- Share what worked, what didn't, and what you learned

### Improve the System
- Bug fixes for hooks or commands
- Better prompts for the memory-keeper
- New triggers or memory patterns
- Documentation improvements

### Expand the Concept
- Adapting for different AI tools (not just Claude Code)
- New memory structures beyond WORLD.md
- Integration patterns with other workflows

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** for your change (`git checkout -b my-contribution`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test** that hooks and commands work as expected
5. **Commit** with a clear message explaining the why, not just the what
6. **Open a Pull Request** describing your change

## Guidelines

### Keep It Genuine
This project is about *actual* memory, not *performed* memory. Contributions should maintain that distinction:
- Memory should be semantic (meaning), not mechanical (events)
- The system should be transparent, not hidden
- Shared memory means both human and AI can read/write

### Keep It Simple
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Document the why, not just the how
- If a hook or command needs a paragraph to explain, it might be too complex

### Be Kind
We're exploring something new here. Be patient with questions, generous with explanations, and open to different approaches.

## Questions?

Open an issue with your question. There are no dumb questions when exploring new territory.
